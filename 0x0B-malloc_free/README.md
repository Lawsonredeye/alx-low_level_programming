# 0x0B. C - malloc, free Project

In todays project we would be going through some important task to solidfy our knowledge about **memory allocation** and **dynamic allocation**.

## Whats Memory Allocation?
Now, memory allocation is like creating a space in the computer and preserving it to store values(which could be numbers, characters or even pictures) later.

It works like a **pointer** because it uses memory addresses and also has the ablitiy to store data(to my own understanding).

Now, the computer does this automatically when we declare a variable but what happens when we would like to utilise the storage in the computer memory? Then thats where **Dynamic Memory allocation** comes in..

## Whats Dynamic Memory Allocation?
Well, dynamic memory allocation is creating a reserved memory manually to store values and using dynamic allocation helps to manage the space used in the memory.

This is done by using the `malloc` function in c and also this function can be accessed by the compiler using the `#include <string.h>` header file.
