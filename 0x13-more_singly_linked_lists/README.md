# More singly linked lists
This is an extension of the more singly list and how its used.

When it comes to knowing what singy list are they are linked list that moves in a single direction either forward or backward.
The singly list is much better when it comes to deleting nodes or even adding a new node or a value to a list.
The down side of the linked list is that the linked list occupies much more memory than arrays and so does double linked list.

why Does Double Linked List Occupies Much Memory
This is so because when youre trying to traverse across a list especially singly linked list you would need a pointer and using a pointer alongside the value / data to move to the next list would not only consume much but also allow you to move to one direction.
when using double linked list youll need two pointers to store the memory address of both the node at the from of the current node and another pointer behind the current node thus the case of double linked list taking much more memory than arrays or even singly linked list.
